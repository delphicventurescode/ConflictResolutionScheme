# README for the Conflict Resolution Scheme/Protocol

I am debuting the Conflict Resolution Scheme/Protocol this
month (February 2019). I have already showed it to a few prominent people
whose names you might recognize. But because most of the way I approach
Communication, I will keep those names confidential. It is only fair that
those who email me and those who I email have some expectation of privacy.

I have been using this system for a while,but virtually all of it is
private communication. Because most of the discussions were private, i.e., 
they were over email, Facebook Messenger (abbreviated as FB) & other private
channels (and even Facebook is, generally speaking, what I would consider 
private communication - it is arguably only quasi-private), I have
not made any of the discussions public. In case there is some reason to
make one or more of the conversations public (say, I  get a request from 
the other party to make the communication public, or in case they want me 
to do so for  legal reasons), I would be happy to make some or all of it 
public. But until then, everything is private.

You can see the Public repositories below. (Most of them of the repositories
are empty, of course.)
