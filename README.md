# README for the Conflict Resolution Scheme/Protocol

I am debuting the Conflict Resolution Scheme/Protocol this
month (February 2019). I have already showed it to a few prominent people
whose names you might recognize. But because most of the way I approach
Communication, I will keep those names confidential. It is only fair that
those who email me and those who I email have some expectation of privacy.

I have been using this system for a while. However, because most of the
discussions were private, that is, they were over email and other private
channels, and email is generally considered private communication, I have
not made any of the discussions public. In case there is some reason to
make the conversations public (say, I  get a request from the other party 
to make the communication public, or in case they want me to do so for 
legal reasons), I would be happy to make some or all of it public.

You can see the Public repositories below.
